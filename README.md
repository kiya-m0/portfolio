Project Documentation: Binary to Decimal and Decimal to Binary Converter

Introduction:
The purpose of this project is to develop a C++ program that provides two conversion functionalities: binary to decimal and decimal to binary. This program is designed to allow users to enter a choice, either converting a binary number to a decimal number or converting a decimal number to a binary number.

Methodology:
This program is an application that offers users a menu with the following options:

Enter 1 to Convert Binary to Decimal 
Enter 2 to Convert Decimal to Binary
Or enter 0 to Exit

The user will be prompted to input a choice from the menu. Based on their choice, the program performs the correlating action. 

Convert Binary to Decimal:

The program will prompt the user to enter a binary number and then iterate through the binary number, and take each digit. Then it will calculate the decimal equivalent of the binary number and display the decimal result to the user.  

Convert Decimal to Binary:

The program will prompt the user to enter a decimal number then perform the conversion to binary by repeatedly dividing the decimal number by 2 and storing the remainder and display the binary result to the user. After this, the user is prompted to input their choice (1, 2, or 0) to select the conversion or exit the program. For binary to decimal conversion, the user must provide a binary number as input. For decimal to binary conversion, the user must input a decimal number. The program displays the converted result, either a decimal or binary number, depending on the user's choice.
Data Flow:
The program uses control flow structures, such as loops and conditionals, to manage the menu, user input, and conversion processes. Variables like choice, num, dec, base, temp, n, and binaryNum are used to store and manipulate data during the execution of the program.

Results:
The program performs binary to decimal and decimal to binary conversions based on the user's choice. The results of this program are relevant and significant because they allow users to quickly convert between these two number systems, which happen to be fundamental operations in computer science. 

Conclusions:
From this project, we have learned how to create a C++ program that provides binary to decimal and decimal to binary conversion functionality. These conversions are essential in various computing applications. Recommendations for improvement include adding input validation to ensure that users enter valid binary or decimal numbers and improving the user interface for a cleaner look and feasibility.
